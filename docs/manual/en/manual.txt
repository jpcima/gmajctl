== Description

FreeMajor is a MIDI controler compatible with TC Electronic G-Major multi-effect.

This software makes the advanced use of multi-effect easy to use thanks to a graphical interface that groups all the parameters of the presets.

It offers the possibility of retrieving user presets from the G-Major, creating new ones, modifying existing ones, importing them, exporting them ...

You will discover all the possibilities offered by FreeMajor by reading this manual.

== Installation

The project provides downloads for the Windows system. +
https://github.com/linuxmao-org/FreeMajor/releases

If you do not have a downloadable version for your operating system, you will need to recover the source code and build it yourself.
Visit the project home page and follow the construction steps in the file README.md.

== How to use

When the controller is opened, the window displays the graphical interface where you can find all the settings that are physically available on the G-Major and the functions needed to transfer the data to the G-Major.

The layout of the controller is divided into two parts&nbsp;:

The first part at the top of the user interface groups&nbsp;:

* Patches

* MIDI

* Patch parameters

image::../resources/en/parameters.png[parameters,586,100]

* Parameter infos

image::../resources/en/infos.png[infos,321,110]

The second part at the bottom of the user interface groups the effects&nbsp;:

- Noise Gate

- Compressor

- Equalizer

- Filter

- Pitch

- Chorus / Flanger

- Delay

- Reverb

The use of different algorithms is documented in the G-Major manual. It is for this reason that we will not return here.

=== Patches

Selection Window - Select a preset on which you want to work in the list of presets. If the real-time option is activated, the preset will be sent to the G-Major who will load this patch into the user bank and change the preset to use it.

Load - Loads a previously saved .realmajor preset bank file. This resets FreeMajor and displays only the presets contained in the loaded bank.

Save - Saves all the presets being edited in FreeMajor to a preset bank file .realmajor.

New - Creates a new empty preset in the selected position. If a preset is present on this location it is destroyed.

Change - If the real-time option is off, this button changes the G-Major preset.

Copy - Copy an existing preset to the selected position. If a preset is present on this location it is destroyed.

Delete - Destroys the selected preset.

Import - Import presets previously exported or downloaded from guitar patches.

Export - Exports presets as a .realpatch file, which can be dropped onto guitar patches or exchanged with other users.

=== MIDI

The MIDI menu allows you to select the midi-out interface to use.
The real time checkmark switches to the real-time mode. This mode allows you to apply changes instantly.
Send - This button sends the current preset to the G-Major when the real-time mode is not activated.

=== Patch parameters

Here you set the routing, the relays, the tap tempo, the preset volume. To change the name of the current preset, simply write the new name in the patchname field and press enter. In real-time mode, the new name is sent to the G-Major which updates it.

The 'modifiers' button opens a window which allows to assign a parameter to a 'modifier' and to allow the adjustment of the response curve.
It is in the following form&nbsp;:

.Modifiers assignment and adjustment window.
